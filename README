Simple script that scrapes the volume usage page on an
iiNet customer account and prints out the account stats.

Requires python 2.6+ and the BeautifulSoup module.

Obviously if the page changes, this script will need to as well.
Only tested on a single home account and comes with no warranty whatsoever.

NOTE: Apparently there is an unofficial XML feed now. Use that. 0_o
